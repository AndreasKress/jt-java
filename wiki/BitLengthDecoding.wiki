= BitLength Algorithm =

The BitLength algorithm runs an adaptive-width bit field encoding for each value. For each input value the number of bits needed to represent it is calculated and compared to the
current "field width". The current field width is then adjusted upwards or downwards, this
increment or decrement of the current field width is indicated for each encoded value by a prefix code stored with each value.

The implementation is quite straightforward. The loop starts by reading the prefix (`if (encodedBits.readAsInt(1) == 0)`
